Hi there!
My name is David and I am a Data Scientist from Lisbon, Portugal.

I am into messing with Linux systems, digital privacy and the impacts of big tech on society and democracy. 

I also enjoy reading novels. Among my favorites are "100 Years of Solitude" by Gabriel Garcia Márquez and "As Intermitências da Morte" ("Death with Interruptions") from José Saramago.
Occasionally, I also play some computer games and I am constantly listening to music!

Feel free to say hello or ask a question. You can email me at [dfhssilva@protonmail.com](mailto:dfhssilva@protonmail.com) if you want to reach out.

# Professional Information
I work as a Data Scientist, having connections to both the academic and industry worlds. 
On one side, I have taught hundreds of students at [NOVA IMS](novaims.unl.pt) and done research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval topics, on the other I have worked since 2021 in multiple companies doing mostly Data Science and some Data Engineering.

I am interested in applying NLP to help find meaningful information over large corpora of text, and in operationalizing Machine Learning models and systems.

I have a Bachelors in Information Management and a Masters in Data Science and Advanced Analytics at [NOVA IMS](novaims.unl.pt). 
For my master thesis, I have focused in applying sentence embeddings models to encode the semantics of news articles and produce a vectorial representation of such corpus, with the purpose of providing a basis for a knowledge extraction system that utilizes topic modeling, information retrieval, and dimensionality reduction techniques to allow efficient information searching and exploration.
This was a project supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, which resulted in the paper "MapIntel: Enhancing Competitive Intelligence Acquisition through Embeddings and Visual Analytics" published in the EPIA 2022 conference.

For further details you can find my CV [here]().

## Side Projects
I sometimes take the opportunity to participate in Data Science related projects outside of work or school context. 
From May 2020 to May 2021, I volunteered in the "Latin America Forest and Landscape Restoration" project at [DSSG Solve](https://www.solveforgood.org/) where I helped to develop a semi-automated policy analysis tool with NLP techniques to identify financial and economic incentives, as well as the type of incentive instrument employed, among Forest and Landscape Preservation and Restoration policy documents from Latin American countries like El Salvador and Peru. 
The main goal was to build a tool to aid policymakers in making more informed and coordinated decisions, ultimately helping in the preservation and restoration of natural resources.
We published the paper ["Using machine learning to identify incentives in forestry policy: Towards a new paradigm in policy analysis"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2021.102624) in the Forest Policy and Economics journal.

# Offline
Because life is wider than a computer screen, I also enjoy spending time with my friends and do some other offline activities.

During my student years, I played futsal (indoors football) as the goal keeper for my faculty team. During this period we climbed to the first division of the Lisbon university futsal tournament.

I also absolutely love traveling! During my Erasmus exchange in 2019, I spend 6 months studying in Ljubljana, Slovenia and I had the chance to travel to countries and cities in central Europe and the Balkans.

In more recent years, I have continued traveling although with less frequency due to Covid-19 and work.
