## The MapIntel Application
The MapIntel web app allows you to interactively explore and search a corpus of text documents.
The user interface is composed by 4 main components: a **search box** where you can write a natural languange query to get relevant results, an **interactive map of the corpus** that can be used to explore the documents, a **sidebar** at the left where filters can be applied to the corpus, and a **list of results** showing the most relevant documents to the query written in the search box.

## Semantic Search
One of the main features of our application is **semantic searching**. 
You can write any query in the search box, like for example, "Suez Canal world trade impact", and get back results that are semantically related to the query, as you can see in the list of results below.
Notice how each result refers to the Suez Canal Blockage and contains the title and an excerpt of the article, together with the relevancy score for the query.
You can also click on the image alongside the text which will redirect you to the original article page.

## Semantic Map
At the same time the query results are given, the query is also plotted in the interactive map where you can explore the text documents that are close to it.
These are the most relevant documents to the query.
By hovering the mouse over the documents, we can see the topic that they belong, as well as their content, and their title.

- Wait 3 seconds

## Filters
We can also tune the search results and documents that appear in the map by tweaking the filters on the sidebar.
We can, for example, select only specific topics, like the 6th topic: stocks_china_stock_market, or even reduce the date range for a specific period of time.
Once we click on submit, the query is performed again and the filters will apply to the resulted documents, both in the map, and in the list of results.

- Wait 3 seconds

## Reverse query
As a final demonstration of our application effectiveness, we can perfom what we call a reverse query.
We can search for a given document in the map and write a query as if we were looking for information on the underlying matter or even for this document in specific.
We can see that the initial document is correctly retrived, showing that natural language queries work as expected.
